## Architecture üèó

Stock Browser uses the *MVI (Model View Intent)* architectural pattern and follows the principles of separation of concerns. The app is divided into three main layers:

1. *UI Layer*: Displays application data on screen using Jetpack Compose. Maintains the state of simple components.
2. *Domain Layer*: Encapsulates complex business logic and handles logic used by multiple ViewModels.
3. *Data Layer*: Holds application data and associated business logic.
